as you see programming evolving daily so to be a great developer in software industry you should have a knowladge, aware about new things and trying to be more compitiable with those changes specially the good parts. and choosing the right tools for your self, business and team.

Javascript is one of the most revolution in software industry. there a long story around javascript and it will be longer.

in this post I will share my ideas about javascript and reasons of it‚Äôs live I will not dive deeply on tech and programming hierarchy this post will be as simple as possible

## the history of javascript.

In June 1997 Netscape raised the javascript as **scripting language** of ECMAScript specification. Over ECMAScript evolved with many and many editions shipped the best practices of writing frontend language and now it‚Äôs used in backends too. because of ECMAScript JavaScript will not die or it will live longer than anybody think.

## Super helpers

After creating NodeJS, Many tools come such NPM,electron and Facebook Hermes.js. Those tools makes development on javascript much easier also increased the productivity of javascript developers. with node js javascript language runs everywhere

Node Js is really big revolution and it‚Äôs help javascript to be everywhere with high performance and here a link of [performance comparison with python](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/node-python3.html)

Javascript is everywhere it's on mobile, desktop, IoT, ML, and AI. You can build a great applications on mobile with react native, desktops with electron, react native and TensorFlow has a Javascript version works for ML. In the other hand javascript is not doing all this independently it got help from another low level language to give it this Diversity and power. exactly C++ and nodejs but nodejs have many this goes wrong as Ryan Dahl, gives a talks about it and raising Deno.

## Is Nodejs gonna die?

I don‚Äôt know, maybe. but it was and still the reason of being Javascript everywhere and many tech using it on production and that's good enough reason to be alive for a couple of years. Node was a great thing makes Javascript stronger than ever before. And many Tech tried to run javascript in server-side even Netscape it self and all tries suddenly fails beacuase the way they used and phailphy but Ryan Dahl win with the pholisoy of nodejs and win. So why it should be die? Because of Deno, Node and Deno both doing the same as non-blocking runtime environment for javascript, and there is some differences between them:
