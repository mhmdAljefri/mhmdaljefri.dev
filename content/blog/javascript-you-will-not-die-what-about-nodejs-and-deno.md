as you see programming evolving daily so if you want to be a great developer in software industry you should have a knowladge and awareness of what's new things in your path and trying to be more compatible with. And choosing the right tools for your self, business and team.

JavaScript is one of the most revolution in software industry especially on web. there a long story around JavaScript and it will be longer.

In this post I will share my ideas about JavaScript and reasons of it‚Äôs live I will not dive deeply on tech and programming hierarchy this post will be as simple as possible

## The history of JavaScript.

In June 1997 Netscape raised the [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") as a **scripting language** of [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript "ECMAScript specification on wiki") specification. Over ECMAScript evolved with many and many editions shipped the best practices of writing front-end language and now it‚Äôs used in back-ends too. because of ECMAScript JavaScript will not die or it will live longer than anybody think.

## Super helpers

After creating NodeJS, Many tools come such NPM,electron and Facebook Hermes.js. Those tools makes development on javascript much easier also increased the productivity of javascript developers. with nodejs javascript language runs everywhere

NodeJS is really big revolution and it‚Äôs helps JavaScript to be everywhere with high performance and here a link of [performance comparison with python](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/node-python3.html)

JavaScript is everywhere it's on mobile, desktop, IoT, ML, and AI. You can build a great applications on mobile with react native, desktops with electron and react native and also ML while TensorFlow has a JavaScript version. In the other hand JavaScript is not doing all this independently it got help from another low level language to give it this Diversity and power. exactly C++, NodeJS built with C++ but it had many things goes in wrong way as [Ryan Dahl](), gives a talks about it and raising Deno.

## Is NodeJS gonna die?

I don‚Äôt know, maybe. but it was the reason of being JavaScript everywhere and many tech using it on production and that's good enough reason to be alive for a couple of years. NodeJS was a great solution makes JavaScript stronger than ever before. And many Tech tried to run JavaScript in server-side even Netscape it self and all tries suddenly fails because the way they used and philosophy but Ryan Dahl win, with the philosophy of NodeJS. So why it should be die?

Short answer because of Deno. Nodejs built earlier and many new things goes after was not compatible with nodejs. NodeJS Design have many issues as Ryan Dahl and the solution was with Deno. Design issue is hard to fix and while Node.JS served with dozens of real projects it was hard to redesign a new NodeJS.

Here some deference between them:

| Feature | Deno | NodeJS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language | Rust | C++ |
| Supported Language By default | TypeScript + JavaScript | JavaScript + TypeScript! need some headech config and some times fails üò© |
| Modules | URLs | node_modules "npm" => lead to Url ü§ê in web |

## Conclusion

Deno conception is better but it's still earlier to kill nodejs. the most good thing in Deno is Rust. Rust is really good language and as frontend developer it the right time for me to learn it to dive deeply on [WA](https://webassembly.org/) And Contribution in Deno Community. Deno run both JavaScript and TypeScript so it your choice. feel free to say no and share you thoughts.
