In the ever-evolving world of programming, keeping pace with the latest advancements is key to becoming a standout software developer. It's crucial to stay abreast of new technologies and trends while selecting the right tools for yourself, your business, and your team.



 [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") has been a game-changer in the software industry, particularly in web development. Its inception dates back to June 1997 when Netscape introduced it as a **scripting language**  within the [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript "ECMAScript specification on wiki") specification. Since then, ECMAScript has evolved significantly, shaping the best practices in frontend development and branching into backend systems. This evolution ensures JavaScript's longevity, securing its place in the industry.

## Super helpers

After creating NodeJS, Many tools come such NPM,electron and Facebook Hermes.js. Those tools makes development on javascript much easier also increased the productivity of javascript developers. with nodejs javascript language runs everywhere

NodeJS is really big revolution and it‚Äôs helps JavaScript to be everywhere with high performance and here a link of [performance comparison with python](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/node-python3.html)

JavaScript is everywhere it's on mobile, desktop, IoT, ML, and AI. You can build a great applications on mobile with react native, desktops with electron and react native and also ML while TensorFlow has a JavaScript version. In the other hand JavaScript is not doing all this independently it got help from another low level language to give it this Diversity and power. exactly C++, NodeJS built with C++ but it had many things goes in wrong way as [Ryan Dahl](), gives a talks about it and raising Deno.

## Is NodeJS gonna die?

I don‚Äôt know, maybe. but it was the reason of being JavaScript everywhere and many tech using it on production and that's good enough reason to be alive for a couple of years. NodeJS was a great solution makes JavaScript stronger than ever before. And many Tech tried to run JavaScript in server-side even Netscape it self and all tries suddenly fails because the way they used and philosophy but Ryan Dahl win, with the philosophy of NodeJS. So why it should be die?

Short answer because of Deno. Nodejs built earlier and many new things goes after was not compatible with nodejs. NodeJS Design have many issues as Ryan Dahl and the solution was with Deno. Design issue is hard to fix and while Node.JS served with dozens of real projects it was hard to redesign a new NodeJS.

## Conclusion

While Deno presents a compelling vision for the future, NodeJS's entrenched position ensures its continued relevance. Deno's adoption of Rust, a robust language, underscores its potential. As a frontend developer, embracing Rust could offer avenues into technologies like WebAssembly ([WA](https://webassembly.org/)) and foster contributions to the Deno community. Moreover, Deno's support for both JavaScript and TypeScript provides developers with flexibility. Nonetheless, NodeJS's established ecosystem and real-world implementations suggest its endurance despite the rise of Deno.
